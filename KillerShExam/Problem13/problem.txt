create a pod named multi-container-playground
pod should have three containers
	- c1
	- c2
	- c3
c1 is nginx
	- have the name of the node the pod is running on set
	as an ENV variable (wtf)

c2 should be busybox and write the output of 'date' every second
to a shared volume into date.log with a while-loop

c3 should also be busybox and should send the content of date.log to stdout
	- just tail
