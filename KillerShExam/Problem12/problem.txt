Create a simple deployment with pods pods
	- give the deployment the label:
		coolLabel=duh

Each pod should have two containers, each with different images:
	- fedora
	- ubuntu
You can just have them running sleep infinity to keep them up

you have N worker nodes. Request N+1 pods
	- BUT THE CATCH.. limit your deployment to only deploying ONE POD PER WORKER NODE
		- this should leave one replica unable to be scheduled if done right!!
