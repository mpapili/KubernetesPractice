This one is really easy. List out your control-plane components and list how they’re running. Your options are:

- Not-installed
	MISSING (or external, like etcd!!)

- Static-pod
	Static pod, usually defined in “/etc/kubernetes/manifests”

- Pod
	A hacky setup with a pod running that’s not static!

- Process
	Like systemd
