Create a new persistentVolume names safari-pv
	it should have capacity 2Gi
	accessMode ReadWriteOnce
	hostPath /Volumes/Data
	no storageclass

then create a PVC in namespace 'project-tiger' named 'safari-pvc'
	- it should request 2Gi storage
	- accessMode ReadWriteOnce
	- no storage class
	- should bind

Finally create a deployment Safari using ubuntu image which mounts that volume at /tmp/safari-data
