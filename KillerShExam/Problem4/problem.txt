Create a pod of image nginx

Configure a Liveness Probe which always returns true.

Configure a readiness probe which checks if "service-am-i-ready:80" is reachable.
	(they give you the command)
	this should fail. the service does not exist

Create another pod that will be matched by "service-am-i-ready:80" and respond.
