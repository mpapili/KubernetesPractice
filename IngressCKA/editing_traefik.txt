While running locally, you won't have an IP exposed for the traefik service to pick up as the external IP address (this is how you see address <pending> forever). You need to use NodePort!

    kubectl edit svc traefik

then:

    type: NodePort

then find the ports and add:

    NodePort: 30000 

-or similar. Save it, and now you should be able to curl ALL OF YOUR SERVERS at port 30000 and get your ingress routing! Nice!
